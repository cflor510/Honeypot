# Honeypot
Week 10-11 Codepath Assignment
Setting up a Honeypot to view intercepted attacks using MHN.

## Objective
To be able to deploy a Honeypot and review the attacks attempted on the Honeypot server.

## Honeypots deployed:
-Dionea

-Suricata

-Cowrie

## Hours Spent:
Around 5 or 6 hours

## Issues Encountered
For the most part the project went smoothly, I didnt have a lot of trouble setting everything up. The only thing I couldnt get running was the map. Everytime I would try to open it, it would say that the website took too long to and it timed out.
